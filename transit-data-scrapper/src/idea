a bus has:
    two lines
        lines have many bus stops
            bus stops have geo location data
            bus stops have multiple bus numbers


What I want to do:
    Ask for a bus line number.
    From this number get all the bus stops that form either line
    Have all bus stops of a line know about their next stop and previous one
